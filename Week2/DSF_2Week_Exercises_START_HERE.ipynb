    "The exercises will mostly take place via Jupyter Notebooks. (If you prefer you can also code in a normal editor and execute the script, up to you, but the instructions are contained in a .ipynb file)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file you find 3 Notebooks, one contains information about Jupyter Notebook functionalities and can serve as a cheatsheet (DSF_2Week_JupyterCheatsheet.ipynb), the second one contains the exercises in Python (DSf_2Week_Python.ipynb) and the last one its solutions (I highly reccomend to check the solutions as a check only **after** you tried yourself, otherwise the purpose of the exercise is lost!). \n",

    "Open **DSF_2Week_Jupyter.ipynb** and start exploring how a notebook works. You can always use this as a general reference.\n",

    "#### 2.  Train your Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Open **DSF_2Week_Python.ipynb**. This notebook offers an overview of the basic main concepts explained in the class. At the end of every topic there is quick-check-exercise. At the very  end of the notebook (Section 8) some more articulated excercises are presented. \n",

    "If you think you need more exercise, I encourage you to make use of freely available resources on the topic. \n",
    "For example https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp offers many browser-based exercises and quizzes. \n"
